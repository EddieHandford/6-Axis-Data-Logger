# 6-Axis-Data-Logger
Arduino uno/due/mega code for 6 axis data logging , Python files to then sort the data to sync


This project was intially invented to model the motion on a pedal bike and log the rotational velocity of
the bikes frame and the riders chest, the force applied to the brake lever was also recorded . 

The purpose of this was to investigate using a control loop to "AUTO Wheelie " a bike with a PID loop

This project however escalated and was sold for a completely different application.
This code is the intial code before it was then developed further , that is not availble for public use.

Wiring diagram is not complete , will be included soon
